# Clisman Mariano

Computer Engineering undergraduate focused on **cybersecurity** and hands-on learning through labs, CTFs, and personal projects.

I am interested in understanding how systems work, how they fail, and how they can be protected. My current studies cover **offensive and defensive security fundamentals**, networking, monitoring, vulnerability analysis, and automation with Python.

I actively practice on platforms such as **TryHackMe** and **Hack The Box**, aiming to build solid technical foundations and practical experience. I enjoy learning, documenting my progress, and sharing knowledge whenever possible.

This repository contains notes, experiments, and projects developed throughout my academic and technical journey.
